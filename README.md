# ECA5376-Auctions-and-Market-Design
Welcome to my ECA5376 Auctions and Market Design Repository!

I'm excited to share my exploration of the fascinating world of auctions, market design, and matching algorithms using Python. Whether you're a fellow student of ECA5376 at the National University of Singapore (NUS) or just curious about auction mechanisms and matching algorithms, you've come to the right place.

#About
ECA5376 is a course I'm taking at NUS, focusing on auctions and market design. Throughout the course, I've delved into various auction mechanisms, their properties, and their applications in different contexts such as spectrum auctions, online advertising, and resource allocation.

#Repository Overview
In this repository, you'll find my implementations and analyses of:

##Auction Mechanisms: Explore classic auction formats such as English Auctions, Dutch Auctions, Vickrey Auctions, and more.
##Market Design: Dive into the principles of market design and examine how auctions fit into broader market structures, including combinatorial auctions and multi-unit auctions.
##Matching Algorithms: Discover various algorithms used in matching markets, including the Gale-Shapley algorithm for the stable marriage problem and its extensions like the Hospitals/Residents problem and the College Admissions problem.
#Getting Started
To get started with the repository, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the directory containing the code or examples you're interested in.
Run the Python scripts or import the modules into your own projects for further experimentation.
Explore the documentation and examples provided to gain a deeper understanding of the concepts and algorithms.
